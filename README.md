# HyperMake

It's a build tool which builds projects **without pre-requisites**.

_Pains_

- Preparing building environment may take days
- Solving conflicts and incorrect versions of dependencies is painful
- Writing long and complicated building instructions when shipping the work

_Heals_

Forget about environment setup, what needed are only

- A running [docker](https://www.docker.com)
- `hmake` executable in `PATH`

HyperMake helps you build projects instantly and consistently without installing
pre-requisites in your local environment.
It uses containers to build projects, all pre-requisites are installed cleanly
and consistently inside the container.

_Features_

- Brings back the experience of _make_
- Selectively build targets on demand
- Build in parallel

## Getting Started

Knowledge required as a user:

- Docker: [http://www.docker.com](http://www.docker.com)
- Very basic Unix shell and command line tools

As an author of HyperMake files:

- YAML: [http://yaml.org](http://yaml.org)

### Installation

Assume [Docker](http://www.docker.com) is already installed, and make sure it's
running properly.

_TIPS_

> When using `docker-machine`, many people encountered the issue docker complains
> unable to connect to docker daemon. The cause is the environment variables are
> not populated properly in current shell. Type the following commands:
>
```sh
# if you are using bash
eval $(docker-machine env MACHINE-NAME)
docker version
```
>
>Make sure `docker version` is able to show both versions of client and server,
>otherwise, docker may not work properly.

Now we can move on install `hmake`:

On Mac OS X, using Homebrew is the simplest way

```sh
brew tap evo-cloud/toolkit  # only do this once
brew install hmake
```

Alternatively, download from Github [releases](https://github.com/evo-cloud/hmake/releases)

```
curl -s https://github.com/evo-cloud/hmake/releases/download/v1.1.0rc4/hmake-linux-amd64.tar.gz | sudo tar -C /usr/local/bin -zx
chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/hmake
```

If you are on Mac OS, change `linux` above to `darwin`.
For Windows, change `linux` to `windows` and unpack the binary to some folder in
`%PATH%`.

Now do `hmake --version` to verify if it's properly installed.

### Do Something Funny

For the first time using hmake, let's do something funny - cross compile Linux
kernel without installing anything, even on Mac OS/Windows!

Checkout the examples in [hmake](https://github.com/evo-cloud/hmake) repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/evo-cloud/hmake
cd hmake/examples/linux
hmake -sv
```

That's it! You get Linux kernel for both x86_64 and ARMv7 (vexpress board) in
a while.

See [README](examples/linux/README.md) for details.

## How It Works

_hmake_ works in a very simple way by running the commands of each target inside
the specified Docker container which already has pre-requisites installed.
The root directory of project tree is mapped into the container under a certain
path which can be customized, and the commands is able to access files inside
the project and can also produce output files into the project tree.

### State Directory

_hmake_ creates a state directory `$HMAKE_PROJECT_DIR/.hmake`
(see [File Format](docs/FileFormat.md) for the details of environment variables)
to store logs and state files.
The output (stdout and stderr combined) of each target is stored in files `TARGET.log`.
Debug log is stored as `hmake.debug.log`.
Summary file is stored as `hmake.summary.json`.
