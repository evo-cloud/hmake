# Introduction

*HyperMake* is a _make-like_ build tool builds projects inside Docker Containers
which have the complete toolchain packaged,
thus no pre-requisites need to be installed on the host.

### What does this mean?

- The project can always be built consistently on any hosts (Windows/Mac/Linux)
  running Docker;
- Anyone is able to build the project instantly and successfully,
  no worry about build environment,
  required software, libraries, version conflicts;

### For example
